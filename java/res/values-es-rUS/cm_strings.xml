  <!-- This string is displayed in the description for a keyboard type. It refers specifically to
the Latin alphabet, as opposed to Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew or other scripts.
When the device is configured to use a language using a script other than the Latin alphabet, the
user still needs a keyboard that can input Latin characters for passwords or login names for
example, and a way to switch to this Latin alphabet keyboard. This string is the description for
this keyboard, so users of other scripts should understand when they read this that it represents a
keyboard that is meant for them to be able to enter Latin characters as opposed to the script they
are used to. This keyboard does not provide a dictionary, and it is not tied to any specific
language among those that use the Latin alphabet. This keyboard is laid out in the Bépo
disposition rather than other common dispositions for Latin languages. [CHAR LIMIT=25] -->
